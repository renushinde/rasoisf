My good friend Ranu had a dream to open her own Indian restaurant in Excelsior neighborhood of San Francisco. 
When, Ranu contacted me iwth this wonderful idea, we sat down for her dream project.
The project started with creating a design and followed by coding.
The hard parat was form submission where I used Firebase.
