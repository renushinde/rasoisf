                <h3 id="about-title">Chef Ranu is bringing authentic indian cuisine to San Francisco</h3>
                <p class="about-text"> Ranu's decades long career has spanned a delectable saga across many countries. Ranu loved to cook as a teenager, and opened his first restaurant in his native Nepal before sojourning to work at an Indian restaurant in Korea. Chef Ranu then journeyed over to the States, where she honed his craft, capping his culinary journey off with stints at tech giants Apple and Dropbox. While at Dropbox, Ranu cooked for many celebrities including Justin Timberlake, Kanye West, Condoleeza Rice, the prime minister of Singapore, and Jon Ying. And today, she works to bring together everything she's learned in his worldly travels in order to serve you the best Indian food you've ever had. <br><br>

                    Ranu's Rasoi features familiar items like chaats, curries, and Tandoor specialties that are crafted as authentically as possible â€” preparations that you'd be hard pressed to find anywhere else in the Bay. Likewise, Chef Ranu also brings his world experiences together to create new and unique tastes you've never experienced before. Whether you're dining in at our wonderful Bernal location, sharing a meal with family at home, or planning your next big event, we'd be happy and humbled to make your meal as special an experience as possible. </p>
